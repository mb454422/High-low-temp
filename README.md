Write a program which will use a while loop to prompt and read the high and low temperatures
for each day from the user. As you read in the high and low temp for a given day, save the
highest high you have seen so far, and likewise the lowest low. Allow the user to end the loop
by entering the sentinel value -100.
When the user ends the loop, print out the highest and lowest temperature seen so far for the
month of February.

note: Why do we use a while loop? We want our program to be flexible enough to allow the
user to enter any number of days' worth of data, and to tell the program loop to stop with a
sentinel value. Since we don’t know in advance how many days of data they will enter, we use
an indefinite loop – the while
